# Datascience-assignments
This repository contains all the assignments that i have completed and will complete as a part of the Datascience certification course offered by https://excelr.in/ .
- The __The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate my profeciency in datascience and showcase my skills to my potential employers__.

<h2> Assignments Description</h2>
Each assignment in this repository represents a comprehensive project that covers various aspects of data science, including data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and more. Below is a brief overview of the types of projects included:

 - __Data cleaning and visualisation :__ Projects focused on cleaning datasets and creating visualizations to understand data insights.
 - __Data Analysis :__ In-depth analysis of datasets to derive meaningful insights and trends.
 - __Machine learning :__ Development of predictive models using Python libraries like Scikit-learn.
 - __Business Intelligence tools :__ Use of Tableau and  excel to gain meaningful insights.
 - __Value added courses:__ Apart from my core Datascience course i have attended value addded courses such as SQL, R programming, Big data analytics and much more which i will update regularly as i complete .

<h2>Key skills demonstration</h2>

1. *Data preprocessing*   - Handling missing data, data normalization, and feature engineering.      
2. *Data visualisation*  - Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots.
3. *Machine learning*    - Developing and tuning models for prediction tasks.
4. *Value added skills*  - These include R, SQL, Core python, Tableau, Excel, Bid data frameworks.

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

These assignments are designed to mimic real-world data science challenges.
They demonstrate how data science techniques can be applied to solve business problems, such as predicting customer behavior or optimizing product sales.

<h2>Code Quality and Readability</h2>

All code is well-structured, commented, and follows best practices for readability.
Each project includes a Markdown file with detailed explanations of the methods used and results achieved.

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
I plan to continue expanding this repository with more advanced projects, focusing on deep learning, natural language processing , LLMs , Advanced visualisation techniques etc.
